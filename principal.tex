\section{Principal bundles on smooth manifolds}

In this appendix we recall the basics of principal $G$-bundles on smooth manifolds, where $G$ is a Lie group.

\begin{defn}[Lie group]
    A \textit{Lie group} is a group object in the category $\Diff$ of smooth manifolds.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
    $G\in \Diff\Grp$ if and only if its underlying set is equipped with a group structure such that the map $G\times G\to G$ given by $(g,h)\to gh^{-1}$ is smooth \cite[Proposition 7.1]{lee13}.
\end{rem}

Recall that for $M\in \Diff$, the $\R$-vector space $\X(M)$ of smooth vector fields on $M$ forms a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket \cite[Proposition 8.28]{lee13}.

Let $M\in \Diff$ and $G\in \Diff\Grp$.
Then the projection $\pi\colon M\times G\to M$ has some nice properties, namely:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G\act M\times G$ smoothly and fibrewise via $(x,g)\cdot h\mapsto (x,gh)$.
    \item For all $x\in M$, $G\act \pi^{-1}(x)$ induces $G\cong \{x\}\times G\cong \pi^{-1}(x)$.
\end{itemize}
The smooth manifold $M\times G$ over $M$ equipped with this right fibrewise action is called the \textit{trivial principal $G$-bundle} on $M$.
We can encode all this structure by saying that
\[ M\times G \in (G\text{-}\Diff)/M, \]
where we consider $M$ with the trivial $G$-action.

\begin{defn}[Principal bundle]
    Let $M\in \Diff$ and $G\in \Diff\Grp$.
    Consider $M\in G$-$\Diff$ with the trivial action.
    A \textit{principal $G$-bundle} on $M$ is an object $P\in (G\text{-}\Diff)/M$ which is trivial locally on $M$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exa}
    Let $M\in \Diff$ and $G:=\GL(n,\R)\in \Diff\Grp$.
    Then the \textit{frame bundle} of $M$, denoted $\GL(M)$, is the principal $G$-bundle whose fibra over $x\in M$ is the set of all frames for the tangent space $T_{x}M$.
\end{exa}

\begin{exa}
    Let $G\in \Diff$ and $H\subseteq G$ a closed subgroup.
    Then $G$ is a principal $H$-bundle over the left coset space $G/H$.
\end{exa}

Some nice properties in the topological category, which probably extend to the smooth category (check!):

\begin{prop}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]
	\item Any morphism of principal $G$-bundles is an isomorphism.
	\item A principal $G$-bundle is trivial if and only if it admits a section, where trivial means isomorphic to a trivial principal $G$-bundle.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
