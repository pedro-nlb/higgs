\section*{Notation and conventions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Top$ is the category of topological spaces.
    \item $\Diff$ is the category of smooth manifolds.
    \item If $\bfC$ is a category and $X\in \bfC$ is an object, then $\bfC/X$ denotes the category of objects of $\bfC$ over $X$, i.e.~ the category whose objects are morphisms $f\colon Y\to X$ in $\bfC$ and whose morphisms are commutative triangles in $\bfC$ of the form
	\begin{center}
	    \begin{tikzcd}
		Y_{1}\arrow{rr}{f}\arrow[swap]{dr}{f_{1}} && Y_{2}\arrow{dl}{f_{2}} \\
		& X &
	    \end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	We will often talk about $Y$ instead of $f\colon Y\to X$, leaving this structure morphism implicit.
    \item Let $\bfC$ be a category which has $\Top$ as an underlying category, e.g.~$\Diff$.
	Let $X\in \bfC$ and $f\in \bfC/X$ and let $\mathbf{P}$ be a property of morphisms in $\bfC$.
	We will say that $f$ has some property $\mathbf{P}$ \textit{locally on $X$} if every point $x\in X$ has an open neighbourhood $x\in U\subseteq X$ in $X$ such that the morphis $f|_{f^{-1}(U)}\colon f^{-1}(U)\to U$ has the property $\mathbf{P}$.
    \item The category of group objects in a category $\bfC$ will be denoted by $\bfC\Grp$.
    \item Let $\bfC$ be a category and let $X\in \bfC$ and $G\in \bfC\Grp$.
	A \textit{left action} of $G$ on $X$, denoted $G\act X$, is a morphism
	\[ \rho\colon G\times X\to X \]
	such that the following diagrams commute:
	\begin{center}
	    \begin{tikzcd}
		G\times G\times X\arrow{r}{m\times \id_{X}}\arrow[swap]{d}{\id_{G}\times \rho} & G\times X\arrow{d}{\rho} & *\times X\arrow{r}{e\times \id_{X}}\arrow[equal]{dr} & G\times X\arrow{d}{\rho} \\
		G\times X\arrow{r}{\rho} & X & & X
	    \end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	We can similarly define right actions.
    \item Let $\bfC$ be a category.
	Let $X\in \bfC$ and $G\in \bfC\Grp$.
	Then we say that $X$ is a $G$-object of $\bfC$.
	A morphism of $G$-objects of $\bfC$ is a $G$-equivariant morphism $f\colon X_{1}\to X_{2}$, meaning that the following diagram commutes:
	\begin{center}
	    \begin{tikzcd}
		G\times X_{1}\arrow{r}{\id_{G}\times f}\arrow[swap]{d}{\rho_{1}} & G\times X_{2}\arrow{d}{\rho_{2}} \\
		X_{1}\arrow{r}{f} & X_{2}
	    \end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	The category of $G$-objects of $\bfC$ is denoted $G$-$\bfC$.
\end{itemize}
