\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In this talk we introduce the stability condition for Higgs bundles and prove the Hitchin--Kobayashi correspondence.
    The main result is \cite[Theorem 4.3]{hit87}.
    Relevant literature is \cite[\S 3 and \S 4]{hit87} and \cite[\S 2 and \S 3]{wen14}.
    Maybe we will also use \cite{wen16} every now and then.

    This talk is related to Tanuj's talk on \textit{Stable vector bundles}, for which the main reference is \cite{kob87}.
    Therefore we will also use \cite{kob87} as a main reference for generalities on complex vector bundles.
