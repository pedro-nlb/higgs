\section*{Notation and conventions}

We usually follow the notation of \cite{hit87a}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M$: compact Riemann surface of genus $g$.
    \item $O\to M$: trivial line bundle.
    \item $K\to M$: canonical line bundle.
    \item More generally, $O_{X}$ and $K_{X}$ denote the trivial and canonical line bundles over a complex manifold $X$.
\end{itemize}
Every now and then we will also use some other standard notation, for instance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For a vector bundle $E\to M$ we denote $\mu(E):=\deg{E}/\rk{E}$.
    \item Let $X$ be a complex manifold and $E\to X$ a (holomorphic/algebraic) vector bundle.
	Then we denote by $\E$ its sheaf of sections.
	The assignement $E\mapsto \E$ defines an equivalence of categories between vector bundles on $X$ and locally free sheaves of $\O_{X}$-modules of finite rank, which we will refer to simply as locally free sheaves.
	We can recover $E$ from $\E$ either using cocycles \cite[Lemma 4.8]{voi02} or by using the relative spectrum \cite[Exercise II.5.18]{har77}.
	Following the second approach we would write
	\[ E=\Spec_{X}(S(\E\dual))=:\V(\E\dual), \]
	where $S(-)$ denotes the symmetric algebra.
    \item $\O$ and $\w$ denote the trivial and canonical invertible sheaves on $M$.
	More generally, $\O_{X}$ and $\w_{X}$ denote the trivial and canonical invertible sheaves on a complex manifold $X$,
    \item Let $E$ be again a vector bundle on a complex manifold $X$.
	We will denote its projectivisation by $\P(E)$, which is obtained form $E$ without its zero section by quotienting out the fibre-wise multiplication by scalars.
	Taking again the algebraic approach we can write
	\[ \P(E)=\Proj_{X}(S(\E\dual))=:\P(\E\dual). \]
\end{itemize}

\section{Stability}

%[explain that the self-duality equations were originally talking about some principal $G$-bundle on space time $\R^{4}$, but after a series of simplifications \cite[\S 1]{hit87a} we ended up talking about rank 2 complex vector bundles on a compact Riemann surface]

%[picture of moduli space of holomorphic rank 2 vector bundles]
%
%[Upshot: a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle doesn't quite determine a solution to the self-duality equation, but almost! Vector bundle + tangent vector in its moduli space does.]
%
%[Use fact from moduli space + Serre duality to translate this tangent vector into a Higgs field]
%
%From now on let $M$ be a compcat Riemann surface (of genus $g\geqslant 2$) and $K\to M$ its canonical line bundle.

\begin{udefn}[Higgs bundle]
    A \textit{Higgs bundle} on $M$ is a pair $(E,\Phi)$, where $E\to M$ is a rank $2$ vector bundle and $\Phi$ is a global section of $\End{E}\ot K$, called a \textit{Higgs field} on $E$.
\end{udefn}

\begin{urem}
    Using the canonical isomorphisms
    \[ H^{0}(M,\sEnd(\E)\ot \w)\cong \Hom(\O,\E\dual \ot \E\ot \w)\cong \Hom(\E,\E\ot \w) \]
    we may identify $\Phi$ with a morphism
    \[ \Phi\colon E\to E\ot K. \]
\end{urem}

%\begin{rem}
%    We are mainly interested in the subbundle of traceless endomorphisms, denoted $\End_{0}{V}$.
%\end{rem}

%\begin{exa}
%    Assume $g\geqslant 2$.
%    Then $\deg{K}=2g-2>0$, so we can find a line bundle $K^{\frac{1}{2}}$ such that $K^{\frac{1}{2}}\ot K^{\frac{1}{2}}\cong K$.
%    Let $E=K^{\frac{1}{2}}\op K^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, where $K^{-\frac{1}{2}}=(K^{\frac{1}{2}})^{-1}$.
%    We consider the Higgs field $\Phi_{w}\colon K^{\frac{1}{2}}\op K^{-\frac{1}{2}}\to (K^{\frac{1}{2}}\op K^{-\frac{1}{2}})\ot K$ given by a matrix
%    \[
%	\begin{pmatrix}
%	    0 & w \\
%	    1 & 0
%	\end{pmatrix},
%    \]
%    where $w\in \Hom(K^{-\frac{1}{2}},K^{\frac{1}{2}}\ot K)\cong H^{0}(M,K^{2})$ can be regarded as a quadratic differential.
%\end{exa}

\begin{udefn}[Stability]
    A Higgs bundle $(E,\Phi)$ is said to be \textit{stable} if for every $\Phi$-invariant line bundle $L\subseteq E$ we have $\mu(L)<\mu(E)$, where $\Phi$-invariance means that $\Phi(L)\subseteq L\ot K$.
\end{udefn}

\begin{urem}
    $(E,0)$ is stable if and only if $E$ is stable in the usual sense.
\end{urem}

\begin{cexe}{A}
    There are no stable Higgs bundles on $\P^{1}$.
    [\textit{Hints below}\footnote{Grothedieck's theorem allows us to write $\Phi$ as a matrix.
    What can we say about each entry?
    The solution can be found in \cite[Remark (3.2) (iii)]{hit87a}}]
\end{cexe}

%\begin{exa}
%    Assume $g\geqslant 2$ and consier $E=K^{\frac{1}{2}}\op K^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ again.
%    Then $\Phi_{0}$ is stable, because $K^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ is the only $\Phi_{0}$-invariant line bundle and
%    \[ \deg{K^{-\frac{1}{2}}}=1-g<0=\frac{\deg{E}}{2}. \]
%\end{exa}

\begin{lm}
    Let $(E_{1},\Phi_{1})$ and $(E_{2},\Phi_{2})$ be stable pairs with $\Lambda^{2}E_{1}\cong \Lambda^{2}E_{2}$.
    Let $\Psi\colon E_{1}\to E_{2}$ be a non-zero morphism such that $(\Psi\ot \id_{K}) \circ \Phi_{1}=\Phi_{2}\circ \Psi$.
    Then $\Psi$ is an isomorphism.
    \begin{proof}
	We prove the result by contradiction.
	Suppose that $\Psi$ is not an isomorphism.
	The rank $x\mapsto \dim_{\C}\Psi_{x}(E_{1,x})$ is upper semi-continuous \cite[Proposition 1.3.2]{ati89}, so the rank of $\Psi$ cannot be generically zero.
	If the rank was generically $2$, then $\det(\Psi)\in H^{0}(M,\Lambda^{2}\E_{1}\dual\ot\Lambda^{2}\E_{2})$ would be generically non-zero.
	But $\Lambda^{2}E_{1}\cong\Lambda^{2}E_{2}$, so $\det(\Psi)\in H^{0}(M,\O)=\C$ must be a constant and $\Psi$ would be an isomorphism.
	Therefore the rank is generically $1$, only going down to $0$ at special points.

	Let $L_{1}\subseteq E_{1}$ be the largest rank $1$ subbundle of $E_{1}$ contained in the kernel of $\Psi$.
	Let $v_{1}\in L_{1,x}$, and let $z$ be a holomorphic coordinate around a general point $x\in M$.
	Then we can write $\Phi_{1}(v_{1})=\phi_{1,x}(v_{1})\ot dz$ for some $\phi_{1,x}\in \End(E_{1,x})$.
	Then
	\[ 0=\Phi_{2,x}(\Psi_{x}(v_{1}))=(\Psi\ot \id_{K})_{x}(\phi_{1,x}(v_{1})\ot dz)=\Psi_{x}(\phi_{1,x}(v_{1}))\ot dz, \]
	so $\phi_{1,x}(v_{1})\in \Ker(\Psi_{x})=L_{1,x}$.
	Since it suffices to check $\Phi_{1}(L_{1})\subseteq L_{1}\ot K$ generically, this shows that $L_{1}$ is $\Phi_{1}$-invariant.

	Let now $L_{2}\subseteq E_{2}$ be the largest rank $1$ subbundle of $E_{2}$ containing the image of $\Psi$.
	Let $v_{2}=\Psi(v_{1})\in L_{2,x}$ be a vector over a general point $x\in M$, which can thus be written as the image under $\Psi$ of someone in $E_{1}$.
	Then
	\[ \Phi_{2,x}(\Psi_{x}(v_{1}))=(\Psi\ot \id_{K})_{x}(\phi_{1,x}(v_{1})\ot dz)=\Psi_{x}(\phi_{1,x}(v_{1}))\ot dz, \]
	so $\phi_{2,x}(v_{2})\in \Im(\Psi_{x})=L_{2,x}$.
	Since it suffices to check $\Phi_{2}(L_{2})\subseteq L_{2}\ot K$ generically, this shows that $L_{2}$ is $\Phi_{2}$-invariant.

	Now we use that $(E_{i},\Phi_{i})$ are stable to deduce that
	\[ \deg(L_{i})<\frac{d}{2} \]
	for $i\in \{1,2\}$, where $d:=\deg(\Lambda^{2}E_{1})=\deg(\Lambda^{2}E_{2})$.
	Since $L_{1}$ is contained in the kernel of $\Psi$, $\Psi$ induces a non-zero morphism of line bundles $E_{1}/L_{1}\to L_{2}$, which corresponds to a non-zero global section of $(E_{1}/L_{1})\dual\ot L_{2}$.
	Line bundles with negative degree do not have any non-zero global sections, so we must have $\deg(E_{1}/L_{1})\leqslant \deg(L_{2})$.
	Therefore
	\[ \frac{d}{2}<\deg(\Lambda^{2}E_{1})-\deg(L_{1})=\deg(E_{1}/L_{1})\leqslant \deg(L_{2})<\frac{d}{2}, \]
	a contradiction.
	Hence $\Psi$ must be an isomorphism.
    \end{proof}
\end{lm}

\begin{lm}\label{lm:traceless}
    Let $E\to M$ be a rank $2$ vector bundle and denote by $\End_{0}(E)$ the vector bundle of traceless endomorphisms.
    Then there is a natural projection $\pr_{0}\colon \End(E)\to \End_{0}(E)$ whose kernel is the trivial line bundle of multiples of the identity, yielding a short exact sequence
    \[ 0\to \O\to \sEnd(\E)\to \sEnd_{0}(\E)\to 0. \]
    In particular, $\deg(\ch(\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)\td(\w\dual))_{1}=3g-3$.
    \begin{proof}
	Over $x\in M$, the map $\pr_{0,x}\colon \End(E_{x})\to \End_{0}(E_{x})$ is given by
	\[ A\mapsto A-\frac{\tr(A)}{2}\id_{E_{x}}. \]
	The endomorphisms in the kernel are precisely the multiples of the identity.
	This fibre-wise description globalizes to the desired short exact sequence.

	For the Chern class computation we use the axioms in \cite[Appendix A]{har77}.
	We have
	\[ c_{1}(\sEnd_{0}(\E))=c_{1}(\sEnd(\E))=c_{1}(\E\dual\ot\E)=0, \]
	therefore
	\[ \ch(\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)=3+c_{1}(\sEnd_{0}(\E))+3c_{1}(\w)=3+3c_{1}(\w). \]
	We also have
	\[ \td(\w\dual)=1-\frac{c_{1}(\w)}{2}, \]
	so multiplying the two expressions we obtain
	\[ \ch(\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)\td(\w\dual)=3+\frac{3}{2}c_{1}(\w). \]
	Since $\deg(c_{1}(\w))=2g-2$, the result follows.
    \end{proof}
\end{lm}

\begin{unota}
    Let us denote by $\Vec_{2}(M)$ the set of rank $2$ vector bundles on $M$.
    We define the following subsets:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item $\bfS:=\{ E\in \Vec_{2}(M)\mid \exists \Phi \text{ such that }(E,\Phi)\text{ is stable}\}$.
	\item $\bfA:=\{ E\in \Vec_{2}(M)\mid \text{a general }\Phi\text{ has no invariant }L \}$.
	\item $\bfB:=\{ E\in \Vec_{2}(M)\mid \exists L\text{ invariant for all }\Phi\}$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{unota}

\begin{lm}\label{lm:twocases}
    If $g\geqslant 2$, then
    \[ \Vec_{2}(M)=\bfA\sqcup \bfB. \]
    \begin{proof}
	Let $\pi\colon \P(E)\to M$ be the projectivization of our rank $2$ vector bundle and let $O(-1)\to \P(E)$ denote the tautological line bundle, whose fiber over $[v]\in \P(E)$ is the line $\{\lambda v\mid \lambda\in \C\}\subseteq E_{\pi([v])}$ spanned by $v$.
	Denote also $O(l):=O(-1)^{\ot (-l)}$.
	If $\F$ is a sheaf on $\P(E)$, we denote $\F(l):=\F\ot \O(l)$, where $\O(l)$ denotes the sheaf of sections of $O(l)$.
	We have $\pi_{*}\O(l)=S^{l}(\E\dual)$ for all $l\geqslant 0$ and $\pi_{*}\O(l)=0$ for all $l<0$ \cite[Exercise III.8.4]{har77}.

	Let $x\in M$.
	Given $A\in \End(E_{x})$, we define the quadratic form $v\mapsto Av\wedge v$ with values in $\Lambda^{2}E_{x}$, which can then be naturally regarded as an element in $S^{2}(E_{x}\dual)\ot\Lambda^{2}E_{x}$.
	The resulting quadratic form is trivial precisely when $A=\lambda\id_{E_{x}}$ for some $\lambda\in \C$, so by \Cref{lm:traceless} we obtain an injective homomorphism $\End_{0}(E_{x})\to S^{2}(E_{x}\dual)\ot \Lambda^{2}E_{x}$.
	Both vector spaces have the same dimension, so this must be an isomorphism.
	These isomorphisms globalize to an isomorphism $\End_{0}(E)\cong S^{2}(E\dual)\ot \Lambda^{2}E$, hence we obtain an isomorphism
	\[ \sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w\cong \pi_{*}\O(2)\ot \w \ot \Lambda^{2}\E. \]
	The projection formula yields now an isomorphism $\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w\cong \pi_{*}(\pi^{*}(\w\ot \Lambda^{2}\E)(2))$, hence an isomorphism
	\[ \psi \colon H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)\cong H^{0}(\P(E),\pi^{*}(\w\ot \Lambda^{2}\E)(2)). \]
	Let now $\Phi\in H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)$.
	A line bundle $L\subseteq E$ is then $\Phi$-invariant precisely when $\psi(\Phi)$ vanishes at all $[v]\in \P(L)\subseteq \P(E)$.
	In other words, $L$ is $\Phi$-invariant if and only if $\sigma(M)\subseteq \div(\psi(\Phi))$, where $\div(-)$ denotes the divisor of zeros of a section and $\sigma\colon M=\P(L)\to \P(E)$ is the section induced by $L\subseteq E$.

	Suppose now that $\Phi\in H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)$ is not nilpotent and let $L\subseteq E$ be a $\Phi$-invariant line bundle.
	Then over a general point $x\in M$, the corresponding traceless endomorphism $\phi_{x}\in \End_{0}(E_{x})$ is diagonalizable, so we can find some eigenvector $v\in E_{x}\setminus L_{x}$ in an eigenspace other than $L_{x}$.
	This gives us a point $[v]\in \P(E)\setminus \sigma(M)$ on which $\psi(\Phi)$ vanishes.
	Hence $\sigma(M)$ is a proper irreducible component of the divisor $\div(\psi(\Phi))$.

	The previous discussion shows that if $\Phi$ is not nilpotent and $\div(\psi(\Phi))$ is irreducible, then there are no invariant line bundles $L\subseteq E$.
	By Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch and \Cref{lm:traceless} we have
	\[ h^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)\geqslant 3g-3\geqslant 3, \]
	so the complete linear system defined by the invertible sheaf $\pi^{*}(\w\ot\Lambda^{2}\E)(2)$ has dimension at least $2$.
	If this linear system does not have a fixed divisor, then Bertini's theorem \cite[Theorem 7.19]{iit82} tells us that $\div(\psi(\Phi))$ is irreducible for a general $\Phi\in H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)$.
	Since in our case $\Phi\in H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)$ is nilpotent if and only if $\Phi^{2}=0$, a general $\Phi$ is not nilpotent.
	Therefore $E\in \bfA$ in this case.

	Let us see what happens if the linear system has a fixed divisor.
	Such a fixed divisor must be the zero locus of a non-zero global section $s$ of an invertible sheaf on $\P(E)$, which is up to isomorphism of the form $\pi^{*}\L(l)$ with $\L$ an invertible sheaf on $M$ and $l\in \Z$ \cite[Exercise II.7.9]{har77}.
	Being a fixed divisor means then that every other global section of our line bundle can be written as a product $st$, where $t\in H^{0}(\P(E),\pi^{*}\sN(2-l))$.
	Since our line bundle had non-zero global sections, both $\pi^{*}\L(l)$ and $\pi^{*}\sN(2-l)$ must have non-zero global sections.
	By the projection formula, this leaves us with only three possibilities:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	    \item $l=0$;
	    \item $l=1$;
	    \item $l=2$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Let us start with case $a)$.
	Let $\pi^{*}s\in H^{0}(\P(E),\pi^{*}\L)\cong H^{0}(M,\L)$ be a global section corresponding to the fixed component of our linear system.
	Dividing all global sections by $s$ and by $\pi^{*}s$ respectively we obtain the following commutative diagram:
	\begin{center}
	    \begin{tikzcd}
		H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)\arrow{r}{\cong}\arrow[swap]{d}{/s}[swap]{\cong} & H^{0}(\P(E),\pi^{*}(\w\ot \Lambda^{2}\E)(2))\arrow{d}{\cong}[swap]{/\pi^{*}s} \\
		H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w\ot \L\dual)\arrow{r}{\cong} & H^{0}(\P(E),\pi^{*}(\L\dual \ot \w\ot \Lambda^{2}\E)(2))
	    \end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	By definition, the new linear system does not have any fixed divisors and has the same dimension.
	Hence we can apply Bertini to conclude that a generic $\Phi'\in H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w\ot \L\dual)$ does not have invariant line bundles, which in this case are defined as line bundles $N\subseteq E$ such that $\Phi'(N)\subseteq N\ot K\ot L\dual$.
	But a line bundle $N\subseteq E$ is $\Phi'$-invariant if and only if it is $s\Phi'$-invariant, so we have $E\in \bfA$ in this case.

	We move on to case $b)$.
	Assume that the fixed divisor corresponds to a non-zero global section $s\in H^{0}(\P(E),\pi^{*}\L(1))$.
	This corresponds to a non-zero morphism $E\to L$.
	The fibre-wise kernel has then dimension $1$ generically and $2$ at special points by upper semi-continuity \cite[Proposition 1.3.2]{ati89}.
	Hence we can find a line bundle $N\subseteq \Ker(s)\subseteq E$, which can be described as the largest line subbundle of $E$ contained in the kernel of $s$.
	If $v\in N$ is a non-zero vector, then $s(v)=0$ and so $[v]\in \div(s)\subseteq \div(\psi(\Phi))$.
	Thus the corresponding section $\sigma(M)\subseteq \P(E)$ is contained in $\div(\psi(\Phi))$ for all $\Phi$ and $N$ is $\Phi$-invariant for all $\Phi$.
	Hence $E\in \bfB$ in this case.

	In case $c)$, the fixed divisor corresponds to a non-zero global section of $\pi^{*}\L(2)$.
	We have
	\[ H^{0}(\P(E),\pi^{*}\L(2))\cong H^{0}(M,\L\ot S^{2}\E\dual)\cong H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \L\ot \Lambda^{2}\E\dual). \]
	So we can think of the fixed global section $s$ as a traceless endomorphism of $E$ with coefficients in $L\ot \Lambda^{2}E\dual$.
	With this point of view, $s$-invariance of a line bundle $N\subseteq E$ translates into $s\Phi'$-invariance of $N\subseteq E$ as before, where $s\Phi'$ is a Higgs field.
	Let us see that the fixed section $s$ has some non-trivial kernel, hence defining a line bundle invariant under all Higgs fields as in the previous case.
	To show that there is some non-trivial kernel, it suffices to check that $\det(s)=0$.
	Since $s$ is traceless, it suffices in turn to check that $\tr(s^{2})=0$.
	Suppose on the contrary that $\tr(s^{2})\neq 0$.
	Fix some non-zero $s_{1}\in H^{0}(M,\L\dual\ot \w\ot \Lambda^{2}\E)$ and consider the linear map
	\begin{align*}
	    \theta \colon H^{0}(M,\L\dual\ot\w\ot \Lambda^{2}\E) & \longrightarrow H^{0}(M,\w^{2}) \\
	    \Phi' & \longmapsto \tr(s^{2})s_{1}\Phi'
	\end{align*}
	Since $\tr(s^{2})s_{1}$ can only vanish at finitely many points, the image of a non-zero $\Phi'$ can only vanish at finitely many points, hence $\theta$ is injective.
	From Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch and \Cref{lm:traceless} we know that
	\[ h^{0}(M,\L\dual\ot\w\ot \Lambda^{2}\E)\geqslant 3g-3=h^{0}(M,\w^{2}), \]
	so $\theta$ is an isomorphism.
	Since $\L\dual\ot \w\ot \Lambda^{2}\E$ has global sections, its degree is non-negative.
	If it was zero, then this would be the trivial line bundle and we would have $h^{0}(M,\L\dual\ot\w\ot\Lambda^{2}\E)=1<3g-3$, a contradiction.
	Hence $\deg(\L\dual\ot\w\ot\Lambda^{2}\E)>0$ and the non-zero global section $s_{1}$ has at least one zero.
	If $\theta$ was indeed an isomorphism, then each zero of $s_{1}$ would give a base point of the complete linear system corresponding to $\w^{2}$.
	But $\deg(\w^{2})=4g-4\geqslant 2g$, so this linear system has no base points \cite[Corollary IV.3.2]{har77}.
	This contradiction shows that $s$ has non-trivial kernel, which contains a line bundle $N\subseteq E$ invariant by all $\Phi\in H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)$.
	Hence $E\in \bfB$ as well in this case.
    \end{proof}
\end{lm}

\begin{cexe}{B}
    Assume $g\geqslant 2$.
    Let $K^{\frac{1}{2}}$ be a line bundle whose square is $K$ and let $K^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ be its inverse.
    Does $K^{\frac{1}{2}}\op K^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ belong to $\bfA$ or to $\bfB$?
    [\textit{Hints below}\footnote{Consider the family of traceless endomorphisms given by

If $\alpha$ was a square, its zeros would all have multiplicity at least two. Conclude that $K^{\frac{1}{2}}\op K^{-\frac{1}{2}}\in \bfA$ using Bertini's theorem.}]
\end{cexe}

\begin{lm}
    If $g\geqslant 2$, then
    \[ \bfS\subseteq \bfA. \]
    \begin{proof}
	We want to show that if $E\in \Vec_{2}(M)$ is stable, then it is in $\bfA$.
	By \Cref{lm:twocases} it suffices to show that it is not in $\bfB$.
	So let $E$ be a stable rank $2$ vector bundle on $M$ and assume $L\subseteq E$ is a line bundle which is $\Phi$-invariant for all $\Phi\in H^{0}(M,\sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w)$.
	Under the isomorphism $E\cong E\dual \ot \Lambda^{2}E$ \cite[Exercise II.5.16]{har77}, the line bundle $L$ is sent to linear forms with coefficients in $\Lambda^{2}E$ vanishing along $L$, hence we have a short exact sequence
	\[ 0\to \L\to \E\to \L\dual \ot \Lambda^{2}\E\to 0. \]
	Dualizing this short exact sequence we obtain an inclusion $L\ot \Lambda^{2}E\dual \subseteq E\dual$.
	Tensoring with $L$ and composing with the inclusion $E\dual\ot L\subseteq E\dual \ot E$ we obtain an inclusion $L^{2}\ot \Lambda^{2}E\dual \subseteq \End(E)$.
	Choosing a basis on each fibre and chasing all the identifications we have made so far, we see that the image of $L^{2}\ot \Lambda^{2}E\dual$ lies actually in $\End_{0}(E)$.
	Indeed, let $V$ be a two dimensional $\C$-vector space and let $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ be a basis.
	Let $L$ be the line spanned by a non-zero vector $l$, which we may assume to be $e_{1}$.
	The first identification we have is $V\cong \Hom(V,\Lambda^{2}V)$, sending $v$ to the homomorphism $v'\mapsto v'\wedge v$.
	This corresponds to $\alpha_{v}\ot (e_{1}\wedge e_{2})\in V\dual\ot\Lambda^{2}V$, where $\alpha_{v}\in V\dual$ is the linear form sending $e_{1}\mapsto v_{2}$ and $e_{2}\mapsto -v_{1}$.
	Denoting by $\overline{\alpha_{v}}$ its image in $L\dual$, we can describe the morphism corresponding to the right hand side of the previous short exact sequence as
	\begin{align*}
	    V &\longrightarrow L\dual \ot \Lambda^{2}V \\
	    v &\longmapsto \overline{\alpha_{v}}\ot (e_{1}\wedge e_{2})
	\end{align*}
	Let now $\beta\in (L\dual \ot \Lambda^{2}V)\dual$ and denote by $\lambda_{v}^{\beta}$ the complex number such that
	\[ \overline{\alpha_{v}}\ot (e_{1}\wedge e_{2})\overset{\beta}{\longmapsto} \lambda_{v}^{\beta}. \]
	A point $\mu l\ot \beta\in L\ot (L\dual\ot \Lambda^{2}V)\dual$ corresponds then to the endomorphism
	\begin{align*}
	    V &\longrightarrow V \\
	    v &\longmapsto \mu \lambda_{v}^{\beta}l
	\end{align*}
	A basis for $L$ is $e_{1}$, a basis for $L\dual \ot \Lambda^{2}V$ is $\overline{\alpha_{e_{2}}}\ot (e_{1}\wedge e_{2})$ and a basis for $L\ot (L\dual\ot \Lambda^{2})\dual$ is $e_{1}\ot \beta_{0}$, where $\beta_{0}\in (L\dual \ot \Lambda^{2}V)\dual$ is such that $\lambda_{e_{2}}^{\beta_{0}}=1$.
	Writing the image of the basis $e_{1}\ot \beta_{0}$ under the map $L\ot (L\dual\ot \Lambda^{2}V)\dual\to \End(V)$ as a matrix with respect to our bases we obtain
	\[
	    \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & 1 \\
		0 & 0
	    \end{pmatrix},
	\]
	because $\overline{\alpha_{e_{1}}}=0$ and therefore $\lambda_{e_{1}}^{\beta}=0$ for any $\beta$.
	We have thus an injective homomorphism
	\[ L^{2}\ot \Lambda^{2}V\dual\hookrightarrow \End_{0}(V) \]
	whose image are the traceless endomorphisms which preserve only $L$.
	We regard this as a homomorphism into $\End(V)$ for a moment and use the basis $e_{11},e_{12},e_{21},e_{22}$ of $\End(V)$, where $e_{ij}$ denotes the endomorphism which, represented as a matrix in terms of our basis, has zeros everywhere except for a $1$ in the $ij$-th position.
	Then our homomorphism is given by
	\[ 
	    \begin{pmatrix}
		0 \\
		1 \\
		0 \\
		0
	    \end{pmatrix}
	\]
	Dualizing it we obtain a surjection
	\[ \End_{0}(V\dual)\twoheadrightarrow L^{-2}\ot \Lambda^{2}V \]
	given with respect to the dual bases by
	\[
	    \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & 1 & 0 & 0
	    \end{pmatrix}
	\]
	whose kernel are the endomorphisms of $V\dual$ represented with respect to the dual basis by a matrix of the form
	\[
	    \begin{pmatrix}
		a & 0 \\
		b & -a
	    \end{pmatrix}.
	\]
	Hence, under the isomorphism $\End(V)\cong \End(V\dual)$ given in coordinates by sending a matrix to its transpose, we obtain a surjection
	\[ \End_{0}(V)\twoheadrightarrow L^{-2}\ot \Lambda^{2}V \]
	whose kernel are the matrices of the form
	\[
	    \begin{pmatrix}
		a & b \\
		0 & -a
	    \end{pmatrix}.
	\]
	Therefore the kernel of this surjection consists precisely of the traceless endomorphisms of $V$ that leave at least $L$ invariant.
	The inclusion of this kernel can be naturally regarded as the composition of the inclusion $\Hom(V,L)\subseteq \Hom(V,V)$ and the projection $\pr_{0}\colon \Hom(V,V)\to \End_{0}(V)$, which writing every homomorphism as a matrix with respect to the bases above has the form
	\[ 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	    a & b
	\end{pmatrix}
	\mapsto
	\begin{pmatrix}
	    a & b \\
	    0 & 0
	\end{pmatrix}
	\mapsto
	\begin{pmatrix}
	    \frac{a}{2} & b \\
	    0 & -\frac{a}{2}
	\end{pmatrix}.
	\]
	This gives us the short exact sequence
	\[ 0\to \E\dual\ot \L\ot \w\to \sEnd_{0}(\E)\ot \w\to \L^{-2}\ot \w\ot \Lambda^{2}\E\to 0, \]
	in which the global sections of $\E\dual \ot \L\ot \w$ correspond to Higgs fields which leave at least $L$ invariant.
    \end{proof}
